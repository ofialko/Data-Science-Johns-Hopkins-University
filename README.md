# Data-Science-Johns-Hopkins-University

Here is all the course material I have been working on when studying
[Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) course at Coursera.
I have also made few course-related presentations and made them available on [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/fialkool)
