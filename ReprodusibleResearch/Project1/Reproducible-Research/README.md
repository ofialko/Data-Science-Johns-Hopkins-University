## Project 1: Activity monitoring

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, 
Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the “quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take 
measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data 
remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for 
processing and interpreting the data.

This project makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. 
The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include 
the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.
