This is Data Science Capstone Project
for [the Coursera Data Science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).

The goal was to create a [Shiny app](https://ofialko.shinyapps.io/next_world_predictor) that takes as input
a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.

The [slide deck](http://rpubs.com/fialkool/slidedeck) pitches the capstone project, while the [Milestone Report](http://rpubs.com/fialkool/milestone) 
reports technical details.
