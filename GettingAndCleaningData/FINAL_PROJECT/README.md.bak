# Getting and Cleaning Data, final project

The script run_analysis.R does the following

- creates a folder "data" and downloads projects data into it
- unzips the data, since project data are all enclosed in a single .zip file
- reads variables names into "features". These are used to name the columns in the final data set
- reads activity label names into "activity_labels". These are used to name activity of every measurement   
- reads measurements data and corresponing labels  into "X_..." and "y_..." data sets
- merges train and test data sets into "X_data" and "y_data"
- uses "grep" function to extract only meassuremtns on the mean and standart deviation
- uses a combination of "cbind" and "merge" functions to name the activities in the data set 
- uses "sub" function and regular expressions to label the data set with descriptive variable names
- aggregates the data set for each activity and subject
- writes the final tidy data set into "tidy_data_set.txt" file.
